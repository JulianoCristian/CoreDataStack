# Container Example
This sample app demonstrates using the BNR Core Data Stack with Apple's
`PersistentContainer`.

**You can help!**
This example only uses some extension methods right now.
It really should be using the `FetchedResultsController`.
A PR that swapped out Apple's FRC for ours would be most welcome!
